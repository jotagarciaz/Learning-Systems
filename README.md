# Assignment 1. ANN.
In this assignment we have to create an Artificial Neural Network with Backpropagation as a learning algorithmt to predict if the different cases contain signs of diabetic retinopathy or not.

What we have done is on the file ann.py, under the folder assignment1. The other file inside this folder is data.txt, which contains the information on the cases.
